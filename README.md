# SaperGame
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


This challenge aimed to create a playable game, my version of the cult game: minesweeper. Educational purposes only. (And a little bit of fun of course.)

In this project you can find easy, medium, hard and custom level of difficulty. The rules are the same as in the old game. 

I have learnt a lot of new skills in expanding this site sing JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

I am a front-end developer to be, so thank you for your feedback.
